        *</p>
        
        <p class="stories">
        My first love was my physics teacher in my first year of college. He was also my first marriage.</p>
    
        <p class="stories">
        It all began when he started talking to me on campus, outside of the class. I was only 18 years old.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">He used to come to my dorm “undercover”, because as a professor, showing interest in student is a really high profile. People talk. One time he even brought me a huge suitcase, filled with Valentine roses instead.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">He’s a perfectionist, at least that's how I remember him. He wants everything to be perfect and he has really high standards for himself. He never drinks or smokes, or plays Majiang like other professors did. Besides that, he draws very well, and plays tennis. Athletic also creative… He’s just this brilliant, unique and serious person. How can you not be impressed when someone like that keeps pursuing you? I soon fell for his romantic gestures and at the end, him.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">He was really good at cooking Chinese food, so he’d always invite me over for dinners. We weren’t necessarily going out on dates; we weren’t even kissing or holding hands.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">But eventually, we developed this very sweet and natural relationship.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">After I graduated from college, he went to America. I had my roots in China: I worked in business, I worked so hard that my cell phone rang all day long.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">I think at some points he came back to see me, three times in five years.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">First time he was visiting some of his family and friends, including me. I went to see him in a foreign student dorm in Yunnan University. He asked if I’d come with him. But I wasn’t interested in leaving my life behind.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">Second time he came and stayed in a hotel, I invited him over to my house. My dad loved him because he’s very knowledgeable. He studied in airspace back then, so he knew everything about physics and space. My dad also loved science very much himself. They really enjoyed each other's company.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">But my mom, on the other hand, had different opinions. She said to me: “Shanshan, the man seems like a brilliant guy, but are you really sure he’s the kind of men who knows how to take good care of you?”</p>
          
          <p class="stories">He tried to persuade me to go with him again. I still wasn’t ready to uplift my life.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">The third time he came back he was determined to bring me to America with him. I was in real estate business, selling houses for the past five years. I thought to myself, okay, maybe it’s time I try something else, something different.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">So I said yes, and followed him to America. Soon we got married.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">When I first came to the U.S., he was finishing his PhD and I just started my Master in computer. He wasn’t in that field but he still could help me with my homework. He was that smart.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">We went through a lot of good time together: we went to Las Vegas, San Francisco, Florida...It was so much fun even we always didn’t have enough money.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">We started to have problems in our relationship. I think it’s the trust. He was always working in the lab, doing tests related to material development. And I was always working.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">I worked in three Chinese restaurants. One was at a takeout place.There were a couple working in the back kitchen, and I was the only person speaking English there so I took the phone calls. One was at a buffet place. Another one is right by the beach, a classy high end Chinese restaurant.</p>
          
         <p class="stories"> I was always working, so it’s not hard for him to imagine that I might meet somebody new at work, since he spent most of his time in the lab. At the same time he also disliked it when I met someone on the campus and talk to them.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">The thing is, it was important to me to learn how to stand on my own, doesn’t matter how decent the person I was with, I still wished to be independent for myself.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">But he really didn’t like that. When I tried to do something difficult or beyond my reach. He’d say stuffs like: “You don’t have to try this hard. It’s okay. Why do you have to do all this?” By the time I realized we actually had really different values and personalities, he became more and more controlling day by day.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">Then he got his job in Silicon Valley, while I was still trying to finish my master in Florida. So we had to live separately for a while.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">And something happened... one time, he drove all the way back to Florida without telling me ahead, and clearly he made this decision intentionally. He couldn’t trust me.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">He came right back home. I was surprised at first then I got scared. It didn’t take long for me to figure out that he was suspecting me having an affair. That’s why he drove back, hoping to catch me in the act.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">That was the beginning of everything starting to fall apart.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">I knew distance was an issue, so as soon as I finished my school, I got a job in California so that I can finally stay closer to him. Unfortunately at that moment he had to go back to Florida to finish his PhD, so we were separate again.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">Soon he did the same thing: this time he drove from Florida to California, all the way across the country for four days. I don’t think he slept. He didn’t even take a shower just to save time and money and he was all stinky. Looking at him like that made me realize this relationship had changed. I can’t even recognize who he’s become: someone devoured by insecurity and jealousy, someone can’t even think of trying to look nice for me after months apart.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">Funny thing is, all my family and friends back in China thought our story was some sort of romantic fairytale, they always say: “Wow, you’re married off to your professor who’s so outstanding in his own field, and he cared about you enough to take you to America with him for a better life. What a lucky gal you are!”</p>
          
          <p class="stories">But only I know the bitterness in it.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">I was working for this small company on my F-1 student visa, and it was my first job in the states. They were going to give me an H-1B. But he was still on his F-1. He did not have a job yet at that point. That’s a lot of stress on his end since he got a PhD but no job. On the other end he was worried that his wife might have an affair and doesn’t love him anymore, so the tension built up.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">Our marriage went into this depressing place where I can feel neither trust, nor affection. Every time I went out to work he was suspicious that I’d meet someone new, someone better. So I wrote a lot emails to complain to my sister, using a computer I shared with him, the old one that came with a huge monitor. Since I had no place to keep a diary and not have him seeing it.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">But he still somehow managed to get access to my emails. He couldn’t help but wanting to know about what I was doing over the computer. Then he saw everything I wrote. And soon he got to know the whole time I wasn’t happy. That started our total standoffs, he was furious that I never told him.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">But how could I have any courage to tell him any of that, when he was obviously the main reason? I felt really helpless and hopeless, that I eventually expressed my feelings to him.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">Turned out he was really upset about the whole conversation, that he wouldn’t let me go to work the next morning. He put the keys under my mattress and he just lied on it, saying: “You can’t go to work without them. ”</p>
          
          <p class="stories">I was terrified because if I didn’t go to work, I was going to lose my status on H-1B, and at that moment that meant a whole world to me.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">So I decided to move out. I was looking at places and I found one that costs $425 a month, which was very close to where I work. But I didn’t have a car of my own at that moment, we shared one car. So it was hard for me to get around places. My moving out plan has to delay, and I was stuck with him. He bought a new car around that time, but he couldn’t afford it eventually so he had to sell it… Those small things triggered his angry hurting feelings of not being recognized as a PhD, catching him off guard; reminding him days and nights, constantly.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">I remember one day, it was a weekend when I haven’t moved out yet, but I just wanted to go out, instead of staying in the same room with him. Living together because you have no choice could be suffocating sometimes.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">He saw me wearing a black low cut shirt, and he immediately thought I was going to see someone. He dragged me back and yelled at me: “How dare you go out like this?” and then pushed me to the couch and tore my clothes into two pieces right in the front.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">Now I think about it this is the breaking moment when we both went on this road of ending this relationship, and we could never turn back. Things can’t be fixed anymore and it only goes south from there.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">I was furious, I remember I simply got rid of him, changed my clothes, took the broken pieces with me and left home.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">Then I remember calling 911 from a payphone in a mall with 50 cents, I told them what happened, that I was really scared. My voice was shaking.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">The police told me to stay where I was, and when they arrived I showed them the broken pieces of the clothes, saying he was violent, I was afraid to go home tonight.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">The police said okay, we need to talk to him. Then they went, telling him that he shouldn’t treat his own wife like that; by doing that he just committed a case of domestic violence, so he needs to go to the police department with them.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">I felt horrible, I even started to take blame on this whole thing and felt sorry for him. I know I might have overreacted. And this guilt only increased when I witnessed how the police arrested him, put him in the car and took him away.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">The room felt empty without his presence, and that made me even more scared. I started to remember what he was saying:</p>
          
          <p class="stories">“I’m gonna kill you!! I am so frustrated, I hate you so much that I don’t know what to do!!!”</p>
        
          <p class="stories">And I was convinced that he would do so.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">Couple days later he returned from the police department, they had to keep him there for the record, making sure he doesn’t do it again in the future. While he was gone I had the car all to myself, I was able to go to work again.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">But the guilt didn’t disappear. I thought to myself that when he’s back, it’s our reunion. We were going to have a brand new start, and everything's gonna be fine. So I asked for his forgiveness for my overreaction.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">He still couldn’t find a job. So I go to work and take care of him at the same time, while he was searching for jobs online. Few days passed and he couldn’t control his temper again, so I called my boss saying that I needed help, I wanted to leave our place but I didn’t have a place to stay at that moment.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">My boss showed up, offering the support I asked for. First thing I needed is a car. So I bought my first Toyota silver. I still remember going to the dealer 6:30pm, spent almost 2 hours there and finally got the car at 8:40. After the deal was done, they drove my car to the gas station to add the first tank of gas.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">I remember myself looking at the car: it was so beautiful and elegant. And I thought to myself today is the day I start my new life, on my own. Since my ex husband always threaten me that without a transportation I could not go to work anymore, that without a car I can’t go anywhere. So I’ve always wanted a car of my own.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">And that day, that car itself, was like a symbol, marking my independence from him. Then I moved out.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">He had to pay $750 dollars rent now all on his own, with no job. He’s been dipping from his saving this whole time. So he called and asked me to come back to him.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">I said: “I’m not going back.”</p>
          
          <p class="stories">He said: “If you don’t move back I’m going to move back to China.”</p>
          
          <p class="stories">I was shocked: “You can’t possibly be serious. You came here so you could build your life here.”</p>
          
          <p class="stories">He told me: “I just don’t know anymore. Lately, I’ve had no passion to stay in this country. Especially with our relationship going south… I’d be much more respected in China as someone with a PhD from America. There’s no reason for me to stay here.”</p>
          
          <p class="stories">I told him I was sorry that things didn’t work out for us, but he still got his own life. He’s a complete person without me.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">He didn’t seem to buy all that. He made up his mind that he’s going to teach in China. He was prestigious in his degree and knowledge, he’d be doing great over there.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">It was weird at that point, I really wanted to keep him. It was a complicated feeling. I even thought since I got my job and my car, he can drive his car to look for jobs, and things will get better from there.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">You see, I still got those fantasies of building this future with him, the future of us.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">So I eventually went back to stay with him, even I had already rent the $425 apartment.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">Then his birthday was coming up. So I decided to do something nice for him by taking him out for dinner. At the time I was able to buy him meals.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">I met him after work. He drove our old car and I drove my brand new car, and I remember he said something like this:</p>
          
          <p class="stories">“Oh, look at your car, it looks so nice; when you drove my car, you were never taking care of it.”</p>
          
          <p class="stories">I replied: “It is a new car. Of course it looks nice.”</p>
          
          <p class="stories">But that whole thing really made me look down on him. I remember catching myself thinking how could I spend the rest of my life with such a stingy shitty little man?</p>
          
          <p class="stories">The restaurant we went is called Todai, a Japanese buffet. They had this policy of giving customers on birthday free meals. I obviously wasn’t aware of that until I told them it was his birthday, and it turned out they only need to charge me.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">After we dined and were walking out into the parking lot, he walked in front of me, and I heard him murmuring to himself: “Huh, actually you don’t even have to pay for my birthday meal.”</p>
          
          <p class="stories">All of the sudden he became so critical about everything I do. Of course I got mad. I said: “You are so fucked up. You know what? This isn’t working. I don’t think we’re ever going to have a future together. You’re just such a narrow-minded man, I opened up myself to you, wanted to do something nice for you on your bday to make you happy, but all you do is pushing me away.”</p>
          
          <p class="stories">I went back to my own place after the dinner, there’s no point for us to hang on to something that was no longer there anymore, or even worse, something that hasn’t been there for a very long time.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">Before he left the country, he asked me to go with him to Oakland to sell his old car to a couple he found on Craigslist, and drive him back.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">I did what he asked. The couple gave him cash. When we came back to his place. I stayed for a bit while he was packing. He started to sew pockets in his underwear so he can bring all the cash back with him to China. All of the sudden I felt like I couldn’t stand something small like that anymore. Then I realized I’ve become the same as him to me. And the second I thought of that, what’s between us had truly been over.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">The day of departure came, I drove him to SFO, to say goodbye to him for the very last time.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">I said: “You take care of yourself.”</p>
          
          <p class="stories">He said: “You too. I know you’d take good care of yourself, I know you’re doing well that I don’t have to worry about you.”</p>
          
          <p class="stories">I asked: “So what are you going to do when you’re back in China?”</p>
          
          <p class="stories">He said: “I’m going to be a professor in a prestigious univerfsity.”</p>
          
          <p class="stories">I tried to keep things light, and the fact that he seemed to have a plan made everything easier. So I was able to think to myself this is a good ending, everyone gets what they need at the end, good bye and bon voyage!</p>
          
          <p class="stories">After I left SFO, I drove back to San Jose. Alone. Then all of the sudden it hit me. I didn’t know why, I started crying. And couldn’t stop for the entire drive. I was crying so hard that I still don’t even know why.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">Did I cry just because I felt sorry for him? Now when I think about it I was grieving on our relationship. The could-bes and should-bes. The entire time I did so much to build this fairytale of two, and now it officially turned into ashes. I was grieving about the effort I made. One thing I know for sure is that I wasn’t crying because my feelings hurt, but one thing I wasn’t sure even till nowadays is if I was still in love with him at that moment.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">That’s it, this was the end of everything, and I’d never know if he was ever to come back.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">It’s something that you can’t hit the reverse button. Wow, just like an one-way road.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">After that I was working so hard. I devoted myself in my career and did so well. I think I kinda hit the bottom that night when he left, and since I’ve been growing from zero.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">Later I was dating different guys, I didn’t really care. Finally I was single again. I dated so many different guys and eventually I had a better understanding of who I am and what I want. I figured someone brilliant with a PhD might not be the answer. I need someone that cares for me, like really… not expect me to be perfect, but just want me to be myself. Then eventually, I met my current husband.</p>
          
          <p class="stories">Cause when you went through all that, you really know what is a no, and what is a yes.</p>
