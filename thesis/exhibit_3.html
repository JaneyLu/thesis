        <p class="stories">
        We met on tinder. Typically usual these days. And the reason was simply that someone else just broke my heart. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">
        We chatted here and there for about a month, then we met up, at the intersection of Montgomery and Market. My phone was at 50% percent of battery and all of a sudden it died. It never happened before and never ever since.</p> 
            
        <p class="stories">Now when I think about it it seemed like a signal: a signal telling me I shouldn't meet up with this person. I figured if I can't find him, I'd just Bart home. </p>

        <p class="stories">But then here he came looking for me. He later told me he couldn’t reach me so he parked his car two blocks away, and walked down to see if I was lost. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">I don’t know why that shook my heart a bit, it’s as if he found me right when I was all helpless and vulnerable.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">For the first four months we were hanging out and hooking up, we weren’t a real thing. He’d refer me as his friend. He used to stay in this place on Post street, near Tenderloin. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">I remember staying over twice or three times a week. Sometimes I just went there straight after school, or set out to school in the morning from there directly.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">We went out every single weekend, or sometimes during the week. Just drink and talk for hours. One time we were drunk, sitting in a diner 2 in the morning. He was playing with my shoelace underneath the table, tie it up then mess it up. We both were just laughing and waiting on our food. Simple time as if we had nothing to worry about.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">Problems surfaced when he started to pick on my look, and things I do. Back then I had super short hair, boy cut. I don’t think he liked it. He would subtly implying that he wanted me to change my hair.</p>
    
        <p class="stories">And then it escalated to all the other little things: the way I dressed, the way I talked. Later on he kept mentioning how ugly I used to be and how he “changed” me to this brand new person.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">On one hand I got mad or not happy about him always wanting me to change something, on the other hand I was also too insecure to stick to my own rules and opinions, and I wanna make him happy so he’d like me more. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">So I always end up changing for him. I liked him, so I was willing to change. If it's better for both of us, why not?</p>
          
        <p class="stories">Then I realized I had pretty much fell for this person, I don’t know, besides the fact he was driven and honest, for the first time I felt I could be loved or desired by someone.</p>
    
        <p class="stories">It was then I started to got anxious about the whole “what are we” situation.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">At the end of May we had to be apart to see our own family, and we didn't know when would we reunite. So I was determined to figure out the label as soon as possible.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">“Am I your girlfriend?”
        “No.”
        “Then what are we?”
        Back and forth.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">I eventually asked him to be my boyfriend for the last month while we were still physically together. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">We were in Lush Lounge. I was drunk and in tears: “Since we’re both leaving and we don’t know when we’re going to see each other again, at least just for the last month.”The feelings already got so strong, and it was mutual. He said yes.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">I remember that month   was one of the happiest time when we were together. I’ve never had that feeling for anyone else before, and it was the first time I felt the reciprocation. He stopped talking to other girls or teasing me about it. He’d give me his keys so I’d go out to buy grocery and hang around while he went out to work, and I’d cook for him, wait till him to get back so we can dine together. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">It was like playing house, but we were both into it.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">We went to a lot of different places: Mount Tamalpais when spring orange flowers would just cover up the whole mountain; Golden Gate Bridge with the sky purple and pink in the background, typical NoCal sunset.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">Then we were apart. I thought as long as we still feel the same way for each other, nothing would change between us. He might just chose to stay loyal to me till we’re both back. I can feel that  we had this connection that is too strong to break. Sadly I was wrong.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">We still kept in touch and talked all day. But he started using Tinder again to talk to other girls. He then got back with his middle school girlfriend: not formally. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">I didn't want to know these, but he wouldn’t keep it to himself even I asked him to. He said he doesn’t like talking to me with filters. He told me that I should go and see other people as well, but then string me along. </p>
            
        <p class="stories">It's so wrong: it was so overwhelming to process all these feelings he poured on me, so that I would share part of the heaviness which he couldn't bear.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">Everyday I woke up feeling like a failure, didn't know what I did wrong. I felt like I was slowly losing control. But I didn't know how to get it back. I was too hopelessly in love. My sleeping cycle was a mess. I got more and more depressed everyday.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">But still, in my head I was thinking as long as we survived this four months apart, then we’d be together again happily in San Francisco. </p>
          
        <p class="stories">I'd literally do anything to keep him, or for him. I've already broke my bottom line, which is my expectation for my partner to stay loyal. </p>
        
        <p class="stories">But just like the song sings "I'd hate for you, and hate you too", eventually I decided to move on after 3 months of pure torture. Then he stopped all this and bought the ticket to fly back to San Francisco. </p>
          
        <p class="stories"> I forgave him and took him back. With no effort made on his end. I was that silly. I remember going to the airport to pick him up. It felt like some kind of dream and he was some sort of stranger. I was happy to finally see him. But I knew deep down things are already different from how they were. Later the same night when he held me to bed I cried. It just felt off.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">“Where have you been this whole time? I was so lonely and stuck in this dark place for so long.” “I don’t know...But I’m here now.”</p>
          
        <p class="stories">Then everything was nice and peaceful for a while. I enjoyed watching him falling asleep, waking up next to him, making music with him till late night. But I never really forgot what happened that summer.</p>
    
        <p class="stories">Sometimes I still got upset about it because he was still talking to that girl he was with. But he wouldn’t really deal with my emotions:</p>
          
        <p class="stories">“ I’m already here with you, I promised you when I’m back I’m gonna date you and I sticked to my promise. If you can’t stay present with me and keep bringing up what happened last summer, I don’t think we should be together anymore.”</p>
          
        <p class="stories">At that point, I just realized I have to stop all the whining to make this relationship work. I learned not to communicate how I feel with him. Cause I know when I have negative feelings about our relationship, he’s probably not going to deal with them. </p>
        
        <p class="stories">I think I was scared of being abandoned.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">So I just keep them to myself. I either fix them, or our relationship will go non existent. And I kept telling myself I’ll try as long as I still can. And if one day I grow tired of trying, that’s the day I leave.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">Days passed by, his birthday was coming up and I really wanted to do something nice for him. So I hand made him a book and got him a Bob Dylan record. We went to a fancy restaurant after. </p>
              
        <p class="stories">We had a good time there. The meal was delightful, so was the drinks and music. Everything was fine until the last part we got into a small argument, and it blew off. </p>
          
        <p class="stories">I don’t remember how we got out of the restaurant. But I remember crying and running after him, still trying to calm him down, apologizing. He was upset and ignoring me. There were a lot of people there outside of the restaurant for a food festival.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">I felt like I ruined his birthday.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">My birthday is right one week before Christmas. His sister came to visit at the same time. So we didn’t celebrate my birthday. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">Somehow I just let all that slide. I always put others' need before my own, especially with him. I think I hate conflicts and uncomfortable confrontations, so it's always easier to agree. And that's certainly not healthy. </p>
          
        <p class="stories">Again, I swallowed my harsh feelings and pretend nothing happened. He said he’d celebrate it for me the other time, but we never did.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">Then we moved out of that place in February. We found this tiny studio in the garage. It was a tiny space with its own bathroom and kitchen built in. I thought it was enough for two. Our budget was tight, we can’t afford anything nicer.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">Then I got hit by a car first week we moved in. I was on my way home from school at night. I was in a short coma, then I remember people were trying to put me into an ambulance. </p>
        
        <p class="stories">The whole time I was only thinking that he'd be mad at me. I was hesitant if I should tell people to call him; I didn’t want to become a burden of his. </p>
          
        <p class="stories">After they checked on me I was put into the emergency room. He was already there waiting for me. He was supposed to make music with his friends that night. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">They were both there. I’ve never seen him like that before. He was worried about me. He walked up and held my hands: “How can you do this to me... I thought I was going to lose you.”</p>
          
        <p class="stories">That moment I couldn’t help but started crying. His friend told me later how scared he was when he got the news from the hospital. On their way here his hands were shaking as he drove.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">He was there with me till 4 in the morning, and drove me home. For the next week he was doing all the chores: putting up furnitures, cooking for me, cleaning my body when I couldn’t get out of bed. He was taking care of me for the first time. And that was when I was convinced that he actually loves me, as much as I love him.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">For the next half year I was recovering, at the same time taking care of school. My physical condition wasn’t ideal. Soon our living situation became a problem. The room was too small for two to working in at the same time. He’s mixing all the time that he had to blast the music, but I need quietness to work and sleep.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">I felt like I was stuck. And at one point I stopped trying in this relationship. His career wasn’t going anywhere at that moment. Money was always an issue. We were both feeling like going nowhere. </p>
        
        <p class="stories">But none of us would say it. He mentioned the idea of an open relationship. Now when I think about it, he was already looking for someone, or something else outside of our relationship. Something I couldn’t give him, neither he himself.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">I’ve changed too much for him, broke too many rules for him and I was starting to get tired of all that. I knew our relationship wasn’t working. But I was too afraid of leaving it. It felt like without him, I didn’t know what to do with myself.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">I really wanted to move out. But I couldn’t imagine what would that do to our relationship. Can I even take it when I go home alone and there’s no one waiting for me? Can we still be together?</p>
          
        <p class="stories">I knew at one point I’m gonna have to leave him. But even just initiating the thought of that breaks me. But I knew that day would come. I never believed I'd be with him for a long time. Doesn't matter how hard I tried, I can't imagine that.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">So I eventually said yes to his suggestion on the open relationship. And I thought that might save our relationship and bring some changes to our life. </p>
        
        <p class="stories">At that point, loving him and giving him what he wants already became a passive habit of mine. I don’t think I had any hope left. Even I was still holding on to it.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">Then it broken down so fast. Faster than I thought it ever could, and it ended so ugly.</p>

        <p class="stories">After all, how can two people who aren’t sure about themselves and their relationship, possibly invite other people to involve in? It was a nightmare.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">He was going out with someone he knew from work. I started talking to other people on Tinder.</p> 
        
        <p class="stories">Given our history, the open relationship didn’t give us the thrill and connection we wanted. Instead the distrust and jealous just built up and escalated.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">We spent nights talking things out. But the next day new things popped up, till the point it was out of our control. </p>
        
        <p class="stories">Then we broke up in the middle of a huge chaos. It felt so dramatic at that moment, now it all seems so far away.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">We still lived together for another two months because of our financial states. I remember going out with someone else and came back home to sleep. He was so mad and asked me to leave, threatening me that he was going to hit me. </p>
            
        <p class="stories">Of course he never did. And when he was out for the entire night with someone else and came back the next morning, I yelled at him and smashed stuffs. Then we’d make out and make it up. It was addictive and toxic.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">I still had the fantasy that our relationship was going to survive through all the dramas, and we’d go back to each other soon when the time comes.</p>
        
        <p class="stories">Until one morning, I went back to our place to drop off some stuffs after staying at a female friend’s place over night. Just to get ready to work.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">He was still asleep. The room was dark. I didn’t want to wake him. So I keep it quiet and before the bus came, I set by the bed and watched him sleeping.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">I was touching his hair, it was a tender moment that brought back memories when we just started out together, until I realized there was another person breathing in this room. 
        
        <p class="stories">Then I realized there was a naked girl laying on the other side of the bed, the bed I bought, for us.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">I didn’t know how I left that place. My co worker picked me up since she lived nearby. On the way to work she kept talking that she didn’t notice I was crying quietly when staring out of the window.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">I kept having panic attack at work the next few days at work. All the voices faded out, I was shaking and sweating and I could hear my heart pounding in my head. I didn’t really confront him. Part of me died that morning.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">Then in May I moved out.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">He asked me to hang out couple of times after, saying he’d still like to stay friends. But it’ll always end up him making a move on me when he saw others talking to me, or even just checking me out. And I let him.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">I dated a few other guys. But none of them felt right. Then I found out he and the girl I found in our previous bed that morning were starting to become a thing.</p>
            
        <p class="stories">The feeling of losing it came back to me. Instead this time I knew for sure that I had nothing to lose anymore except myself. </p>
          
        <p class="stories">There's no "us" anymore. It's only me this time. And I didn't want to lose myself. </p>
              
        <p class="stories">I had to leave, finally. I had to let him go. None of us deserve to be this unhappy.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">Few months after I talked to him once, to ask back the deposit money I put down on our old place where he still stays in. I went to where he works since he blocked my number and social media. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">But I wanted no trouble. I just wanted to ask back my money politely without making a fuss. After all, his life isn’t my business anymore.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">I rehearsed so many times ahead, about what I was going to say, how I was going to act. But I still frozen for a second when I saw him and that girl when I looked into the store across the street.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">“I’m scared.” I told my roommate, who came along with me. </p>
          
        <p class="stories">“Just go. It’ll be okay.” she pat on my back. And that gave me the courage.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">I realized later what an important role those people play to help me out during my grieving process, those who really care about me and always stick around.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">I went in. I looked nice. I waited till he finished serving his last customer and asked him calmly for what I wanted. He wasn’t able to pay me back soon, so I said I’d wait. I was proud of how I acted until he said:</p>
          
        <p class="stories">“Are you okay? It seems like you’re about to cry. Calm down.”</p>
          
        <p class="stories">I was at my best performance. And I still couldn’t believe after all the things happened he was still trying to hurt me, invalidate me, consciously or not.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">But this time I didn’t give him the power he wants. I spoke up for myself. </p>
          
        <p class="stories">I never won him in a debate or an argument when we were together. I never fought back. I'd always give in because I didn't want him to be upset. He'd look scary and won't talk for a very long time. I remember how much I hated it.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">But this time he didn't look intimidating. He was speechless. Turns out bullies are essentially all the same: paper tigers.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">Month later, he called, saying he couldn’t pay me back any time sooner. And I knew there’s nothing I could do about it.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">So I simply walked away. I realized I couldn’t take anymore disappointment from him. The person I once believed was unique, a little bit cynical but always warm-hearted has long gone. And I couldn’t even look at who he turned into now. I’ve lost faith in him, and I had to cut him out completely. </p>
          
        <p class="stories">Since then I’ve been focusing on myself, my family, my friends, my work. I can finally admit that I lost that battle, happily. </p>
            
        <p class="stories">Maybe I didn't care to win, or I didn't even know why I need to. From whom? What for? If I'm only going to get consume myself in this unsustainable crazy love, and get nothing out of it. The scars still hurt sometimes, my trust is damaged. But I'm taking the time I need. </p>
          
        <p class="stories">I was surprised how much things I left behind or neglected during my relationship with him. And by finding them back piece by piece, I started to get back the sense of myself.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">There’s always other people here for me. My friends, my family, people I trust without romantic interests. After the strong and crazy love going out of control and fading away, there’s always someone holding my back that I could go back to. Life still goes on, and I found back my narrative, at the same time a new perspective to look at the world. </p>
          
        <p class="stories">Taking time to just realize all that makes me not lonely anymore. And I can finally say I’m fine now confidently.</p>
