        I think the way girls define their first love is weird. The equation will not simply be drawn as the first boyfriend you got is your first love. It's more complicated than that. </p>
            
        <p class="stories">I think to me first love is the person who left a mark in your heart, and it would take a very long time for that mark to be eased away.  </p>
    
        <p class="stories">
        I met him at an art prep school. I still remember that day. He was late to the orientation meeting. He wore a white shirt, walking in with a stick, backlit. </p>
            
        <p class="stories">I couldn't really see his face, but that moment struck me. It was definitely love on the first sight. He was held back one year, so he's older than everyone else in the class. </p>
            
        <p class="stories">Later on other people from the same grade  told me he had a girlfriend. So I kept that feeling to myself.</p> 
            
        <p class="stories">The next fall I was admitted by an international art school, I didn't know he was admitted by the same school until I saw him on the school shuttle. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">Rumor said his girlfriend was trying to go to the same school, but failed and moved to other city. They decided they'd do long distance at that time.</p>

        <p class="stories">We didn't talk much at first. Our paths didn't really overlap till the second semester. There was an event coming up, and he hit me up through some mutual friends, asking if I want to form a band with him. </p>
            
        <p class="stories">I could definitely sing, and I have confidence in my voice. So I said yes. I had a crush on him, it's so hard to say no. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">He always looks clean, neat and cute. And he dressed in shibu-caji style... But anyways, we didn't have any resources or experience with forming a band; we just wanted to perform. That was the first time I didn't really think of consequences, instead just diving into the process. </p>
        
        <p class="stories">He definitely brought a lot of exciting first-time moments like this to me. But we stayed platonic until the very end. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">We went to see a lot underground live music, also music festivals: whenever we got time we tried to go to as many lives as we can. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">And then our band made a little success: we were on air on some shows of CCTV, made some headlines... And eventually we were just naturally drawn to each other after all these rehearsals, concerts, nervous moments we share... then we became a thing, we got together.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">We made a promise to fly the kite when spring comes. It's from the song of Sodagreen, Incomparable Beauty. Something like "kites flying in the sky, people chasing on the ground; if you're worrying you can't fly, baby you got my butterflies." </p>
            
        <p class="stories">But we never made it come true. I've never flied a kite once till nowadays. It feels like something I had to accomplish with him, at least for the first time. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">He didn't break up with his girlfriend, and it didn't seem like he was going to. I didn't care because I really liked him. Love is love, I thought to myself. As long as these amazing bubbly moments could last, I will pretend nothing else is going wrong.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">But it eventually did. It was two months in our "relationship", there was one time I checked his social media. I don't know why I did that. I never really paid any attention to it before. Not like most girls, I usually don't try to look through their post history and feed. </p>
          
        <p class="stories">Then I found out his girlfriend commented below every single post he made. All of the sudden I woke up, I didn't realize till that moment that our relationship wasn't only between us, there's another person.</p>
            
        <p class="stories">Or actually, I was the other person, the one that involved into a relationship that already existed before my arrival. My pleasure was built upon someone else's pain. The guilt hurts.</p>
    
        <p class="stories">I went through some struggles, and then I decided to give him the ultimatum: it's either me or her. I couldn't think of a better way. Only thing I knew was that things can't keep going like that. </p>
            
        <p class="stories">If we were going to be together, I wished that he'd make up his mind and choose me. otherwise I'll back off. </p>
          
        <p class="stories">He said he couldn't do it. He had been with that girl for some years, he knew he didn't love her anymore, but it's hard to break the truth.</p>
    
        <p class="stories">We were in a 85C cafe when we had this conversation. I was sitting faced the window. The sunlight was too harsh to my eyes. He noticed that and asked to switch seats. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">He talked to me about his thoughts for his own future. He always had a lot of thoughts, weird ideas and dreams. And he always had the drive and due diligence to make them happen. I know that's why I'll always be drawn to him, again and again. But I know I can't keep things unclear anymore.</p> 
            
        <p class="stories">So I broke up with him. </p>
          
        <p class="stories">A week later, my ex was pursuing me. I didn't think much and said yes. I just wanted to get over him as soon as possible. He broke up with his girlfriend right after that. Then he wanted me back. But I said no. </p>
            
        <p class="stories">A lot of mutual friends of ours all came to talk to me, saying he was in a really dark place, that he started smoking and drinking, even crying in the dorm. I still stood by my choice. I said he'll be fine by himself. I just thought he didn't make it right when I offered him the chance, the chance for him to choose me. That's all that matter. I admit I was petty.</p>
    
        <p class="stories">He still cared about me in his own way even we were not together anymore. He couldn't show the care the way he used to, but he tried anyways. There was one time he wrote a letter to my boyfriend back then. It might sound weird but he meant good. He basically wrote about things I like, things I hate, my little habits... And told him to treat me nicely, always.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">I remember one time, a week before the college entrance test. He got me a bag of skittles and left a note on my desk: "This is for you. I spit in it. Good luck with the exam." You know, he didn't know how to address his feelings directly, but he finds his own way.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">We eventually added each other back on wechat and started talking way later. I was depressed for a long time. I'd dream of him and cry at night. My friends can't even mention his name in front of me. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">At the end it's not that some "new love" healed me. I never really forget about him. Time just does its work. </p>
            
        <p class="stories">It's more like I internalized this pain till it's not sharp and hurting anymore, along with all the happiness and memories of him. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">And that becomes part of me that I still live with nowadays. It's as if I come out living with a heavier, yet bigger and loving heart. It's amazing.</p>
