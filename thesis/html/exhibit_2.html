        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">
        The relationships that I had are all illuminating in their own ways. But in another way, I feel like haven't changed a lot. They are all different. </p>
    
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">
            The one I remember the most started one summer, in San Francisco. I met her on Tinder. </p>
            
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">
        My first reaction to the whole date was shallow. We all know that Tinder is all about the look. I didn't read her bio, and I knew nothing about her. But she's cute. So we started talking, dumb tinder pickup lines, you know how it is.</p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">Then we met up. It was June. We went to a day festival. She's from Mexico, English is her second language but she's fluent. She was in school, and was only going to stay in SF for the summer, then leaving for Guadalajara during the fall. She had been called by a reference from the state. And since she had no summer plan so she said yes. It was the beginning of her stay. </p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">We took a hike to lands end after the festival in Marina. We smoked and just sat on a cliff, looking over the ocean. </p>
            
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">
        I immediately felt super comfortable with her, something I haven't felt over years with anyone. It's this calm that you can sit next to a person in silence and don't feel like you have to say something. It felt comfortable and natural. And that makes me immediately very interested in her. </p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">She was really sweet, nice and shy. We ended up sharing a whole day together, and she actually stayed at my place that night. </p>
            
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">
        Next morning she has to go back to North Bay, her place was there and she needed to look after 4 kids. I had a random drone photo shooting job that morning as well, so I told her she could stay in and sleep, that I had to leave at 6:00AM.</p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">When I came back from the job, she left me a written note, which I thought was really sweet. You don't see people do that much these days. </p>
            
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">
        After that we kept hanging out and texting, and I really fell for her. The feelings seemed strong and mutual. We hang out the next weekend, and the one after that. She had time off for only the weekend, so we kept doing the same stuffs and getting to know each other more and more. </p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">We loved spending time with each other. I didn't have a car back then. I would take a fairy off from work, and go meet up with her. We just started to do more and more things together, and that naturally became a relationship. Even we would say there's no label since she's going back to Mexico at the end of the summer, and we both knew this would not be a sustainable relationship. </p>
            
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">I tried not to think about it, even when she post the question sometimes. I told her let's not worry about right now and enjoy our time together. </p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">We went to Yosemite together, it was a super fun trip, and still one of my best memories... We rented a camper van, and just spent the whole stay swimming in Yosemite Creek, being in isolation with this person you love... it's truly a special experience. </p>
            
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">So when it was time for her to leave, we decided to do long distance, which I definitely would have never done in the past. I've always thought it was silly, and I still do. It's very difficult for sure. But when you love someone, and you only got two options: losing her or long distance, I think I'd to try just for her. I didn't want to lose her. </p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">Our relationship was tested for a several months. We'd just talk every night for an hour or two. There is two hour time difference in Guadalajara, so it's actually really difficult. it'd be like time for me to eat, but she had to go to bed. </p>
            
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">It was also during the time when I quit my job, and was trying to build up my own business. I had to concentrate on my work a lot, thus less time to give to her. She also had school to take care of, it was hard for us to line up our schedules. </p>
            
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">But as long as we talked everything was good. She knew enough about my life in Berkeley, and I know what she's doing, how her life in Guadalajara was like and how her family was doing. </p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">Then I visited her in October. I've never been to Mexico before, and everything was amazing. Her family was really great people, welcoming and friendly. Her house was amazing. So did the food. Everywhere we went in Guadalajara, it was all so rich and exciting... </p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">I think when looking back, that energy must be one of the things that draws me to her. I was attracted to her because of who she was and what she stood for. And I got to learn this total strange new world through the lenses of the person I love. And I got to learn a different way of life. That was attractive to me. </p>
            
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">I like traveling and learning about different people, also their culture... When I get to experience that in a romantic relationship, the bond is even deeper. I stayed there for a week.</p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">Then when I came back, some thing came up that we can't plan the next trip to see each other: I got this opportunity to shoot a documentary about a professional surfer I knew. I was connected to him through one of my friends who is also a surfer. There was a really big competition coming up in Half Moon Bay Mavericks Beach. But the event date was dependent on the weather condition, and it might happen anytime from November to March. And I have to be there to film the event when it happens.</p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">She knew that, and because of this uncertainty, it was difficult for either of us to plan traveling together during holiday. She was originally planning to come visit me and my family during Christmas. She didn't want there to be a possibility that I have to leave her to my family and come back to California for this job. Neither of us have that much money. Budget was an issue that she wouldn't be able to either come to California with me or go back to Guadalajara if that happened. </p>
            
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">So we didn't see each other for the holiday, but we still did Face Time. </p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">In February, she booked a trip to Berkeley to see me. It was the longest time we've been apart. I was super excited to see her, that I took 10 days off from my work. And hope to spend an amazing vacation with her. </p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">The date came, I went to the airport to pick her up. I waited in the arrival level. All the people from her flight were out, but she wasn't there. I waited for an hour, she still didn't appear. </p>
            
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">I asked the information desk, they said sometimes flight just got delayed. It is usual. So I kept waiting for almost 4 hours, but she still hasn't shown. Instinct told me that something must have gone wrong. Then I got a call from a random number:</p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">"Hey are you Joe. F?"</p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">I answered: "Yes, who is this?"</p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">"This is border security. Your friend Ana is here with us. We have to sort few things out that we have to ask you a few questions." </p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen"> And then they proceeded to interrogate me about my relationship with her, when did I met her, the reason why she's in the country, stuffs like that. </p>
            
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">I told them the truth, and asked what was going on or if I could talk to her. They said no, that they have to keep her till they figure things out, that they'll get back to me. </p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">All of the sudden I had to go back home from the airport without her. I was destroyed. I was literally in the same building she was in: someone I've been longing to see for such a long time, she was right there. We were not thousands miles apart. But I can't figure out a way to see her and that really fucked with my head.</p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">I went back to Berkeley. I had presents for her prepared, lined up under the Christmas tree which I didn't take off on purpose. I stood there for a long time, with all those things but her presence. I couldn't help it but started crying. </p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">She was caged somewhere. I couldn't talk to her because she didn't have a phone. Later I got a message from her mom. She said that Ana is at the airport, they might send her home to Mexico. That was all I got. She only got one phone call to make and she called her mom, which makes total sense. </p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">My aunt called me randomly to see how I was doing, so she happened to know the situation. She was really empathetic and supportive that she offered to pay for my ticket to Mexico so I'd go to see Ana, which I accepted.</p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">Then I finally met her in Mexico and got to know what happened to her in the airport: what she went through was traumatic. She was there for 30 hours in a holding area, which is essentially a jail. They wouldn't let her sleep for more than an hour a time; they wouldn't turn off the fluorescent light, and they only gave her minimum food... then they interrogated her, screamed at her and asked her all these fucked-up questions. </p>
            
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">It ended up her visa was taken, and she was barred from entry for 5 years. </p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">That all of the sudden made everything so complicated. But since we were together shortly every problem we had just dissolved. We loved each other, and we were content with each other's presence. It was like when I was with this person, I don't need anything else. That's how perfect it was. </p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">But that trip eventually ended, and that was really hard for her. Because she can never come visit me, and I can only go there to see her. Basically if I didn't make a decision to move to Mexico or plan to do so at one point, things between us was going to be really difficult. It had become an one-way mission.</p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">And I knew that, even she offered to pay half of my visit, that I was still the one to make the trip, and it could be a lot of work. It sucks to not know when will she be able to come here again, and if the relationship just hinges on me moving to Mexico, which is a very difficult thing for me to confront at that moment. </p>
            
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">It's not that I didn't think about it, but I wasn't prepared to do so, given my career and my situation. </p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">That ended up as something I still think about a lot these days: the decisions you make and the priorities you place on certain things in your life. </p>
            
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">I beat myself up a lot about that, because I made this selfish decision based on my own life, instead of considering the possibility of starting a new life with her. </p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">It really made me question myself: is this what kind of person I am? The kind of person who will always choose myself over the others, even someone I loved and could see starting a family with. I'd still prioritized my career development and my original family. </p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">That's how I feel at that moment: that I wasn't capable of showing or providing full amount of love to her, and that has become a constant pattern appearing in my other past relationships.</p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">In another relationship before Ana, several years ago when I was in still college. The girl ended it because she felt that she didn't receive enough love from me. She felt like I wasn't putting in a lot effort, or if I was into her at all. </p>
            
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">That was really troubling for me to find out, because I was really really into her, and it was the most intimate relationship I had ever felt at that moment, yet I'm still not giving enough. Is there something wrong with me?</p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">And this fear of not capable of being enough or providing enough for the person I care and love came back in the relationship with Ana. And it hurt, for a while I was struggling.</p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">What happened next is that things just unavoidably moved towards a more realistic path. She was await for me for an answer to our future, but I couldn't give one. She suggested an open relationship, that way she could release some stress from the uncertainty of our future. </p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">But I didn't feel comfortable with that. It feels like as soon as we start an open relationship, we might stop making effort for each other like we used to. And I didn't want to see other people. But her suggestion made me question if she had someone in mind she wanted to date, and I encouraged her if that's the case she should just break up with me and date that person instead.</p>
        
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">I'd still care about her as a person. It's just for me I can't be emotionally invested in someone, at the same time trying to pursue other potential sexual partners.</p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">I know long distance relationship requires a lot of effort, and it's completely different from the normal relationship: you don't have physical touch or quality time, you can't exchange or learn with each other, or enjoy each other's presence. </p>
            
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">It is more like you have someone you can check in with at the end of the day, someone you can talk to. But nothing else.</p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">I didn't want to do that, so we took a break. We came back for couple of weeks, same issues appeared and we had to take a break again, then we never came back. It's just we never get to experience the real moment of goodbye. </p>
            
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">It was painful for her to be committed and in love with me since she can never see me, so for the sake of her mental health I suggested we should stop. She wasn't happy, and that's the last thing I'd want to see. </p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">It was a really weird situation because we didn't want the relationship to end. Sure I say that Trump ended the relationship, but that is not the case either. </p>
            
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">We couldn't get a permanent solution, and future was just full of uncertainty. We weren't in the position in our life that we can figure that out. </p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen"> I was open to all the ideas about our future but I wasn't ready to make them come true when she was barred from America. And that became an ultimatum because I wasn't able to pull the trigger on it. We risked the unknown. It probably seems unsustainable from the outside, throwing all that time and energy into the unknown. </p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">But for me I know, this is my person. And when she appeared, I don't need a reason to love her or try to be with her. This pain and love both come from the same energy source, and both form the basics of human emotions and experience.</p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">When you got too into or out of a relationship, it is dangerous. If you're  aloof to the happenings or you simply don't care, that is not going to be sustainable for the other person. But if you're too invested or dependent, that's not right either. </p>
          
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">I think when you meet someone you really click with, it can be easy to get really deep into the relationship very quickly, and this can be problematic. </p>
        
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">Because when you jump into something this big too fast, drastic change happens in your life overnight, and that changes your whole life: how you spend your time, what you think about. It rewires your brain, and we called that effect love. </p>
            
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">But it's not necessarily the same for both parties. Not everyone could manage to have positive response to this rewiring and reorganization. And then it'll backfire and change the relationship itself as well. </p>
            
        <p class="exhibit-zhengwen">That's why it's so important to have your own life, your individual aspiration. Yes, do something and create something with that person you care, but not something that would diminish or take away your life, or your identity. </p>
